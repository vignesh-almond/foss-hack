Hey everybody. It's Alix here. 
Before we get started, I just wanted to tell you about these cool coloring pages that we have for each of our episodes so that you can color as you listen a little something to do. 
They are very beautiful, and if you want us to email them to you ahead of time each week so that you can be ready for coloring adventures, sign up for our newsletter at. 
The newsletter also has lots of other great stuff you might like, including bonus content and information about our music and links to things that we reference in each episode. 
There are April showers. There are May flowers. And then there's June wedding season.
If you're looking to accost unsuspecting couples who are in the process of uniting themselves in holy matrimony, probably the best time to do it is June in Washington D C
Just go downtown to the courthouse, and you see all kinds of doe-eyed, hopeful couples traipsing in and out with these thin, white envelopes that indicate that they have finally done it , committed themselves to one person.
These people had searched the world and finally found a person - an entity with a very specific set of characteristics that resided deep within them and made them who they were.
This is INVISIBILIA. I'm Alix Spiegel.
INVISIBILIA is a show about all of the invisible things that shape human behavior - our thoughts, expectations, beliefs, emotions.
Yeah We're going to prison. And to begin this prison story, I want to introduce you to four men - two rapists, a violent felon and a thief.
This is a recording of the men, all inmates at the Marion Correctional Institution in Marion, Ohio.
They're warming up on a stage in the prison chapel because later in the day, they're doing a ballet performance there.
I will watch this performance. And it will be one of the most beautiful, moving things I've ever seen. 
Two of the men will do a dance - a duet about love and yearning. One of those two will move fluidly. He obviously has had training.
But the body of the other will be stiff, his bulky muscles forcing themselves into graceful positions, as if the man is trying to remake himself from the outside in.
But that's all later. All I know now is that I have never seen or even imagined inmates gracefully bending their bodies into warm-up plies.
That idea is inconsistent with the model of inmate that I hold in my mind, which is what this story is all about - inconsistency and consistency and our need to believe in a consistency in ourselves and the people around us - some essential personality that defines who we are throughout our lives - a consistency that may or may not exist.
Wait, wait. I think Nurith has a question.
I first learned about the Ohio prison from the two women that you just heard. 
The last voice, talking about cellphones, is Nurith Aizenman, a reporter here at NPR who helped me report parts of the story.
The other voice is her friend Delia Cohen.
Nurith has known Delia for a long time.
Which means that Nurith has witnessed firsthand this thing that Delia's been going through and how it's transformed her view of how consistent people are.
Nurith first heard about it about two years ago.
Which brings us to Dan.
Dan was one of the inmate organizers of the TEDx event at Marion.
But here's the thing. As soon as Delia starts talking to Dan, she totally forgets about the tattoo. 
Dan's personality just doesn't seem to have anything to do with the word hatred.
It was a puzzle. And then the show began.
The show featured some of the normal talks that you would hear at any TED event - but also poems and skits and songs written by inmates.
Dan, the other organizers - everybody is thrilled by this idea.
But then, literally as Delia is leaving, something happens that changes everything.
This, of course, is Dan. In order to speak with him, we agreed not to use his full name. Marion's Office of Victim Services felt it would be less difficult for the victim that way.
Also, we weren't allowed to interview Dan at all about his crime. Still, we wanted to hear Dan's side. 
So we set up the interview and started by asking about how he responded to Delia's email.
See, Dan is used to people being disgusted by him and his crime.
So how should we think about Dan and people like him? Should we, like Delia, see their crimes as emanating from who they are - what happened as a product of their character or personality?
Really, this is a question for all of us. 
When we tell stories of lives - criminal lives or even successful ones - the legendary businessman, the beloved teacher - usually at the center of the story is a personality, a set of consistent characteristics fundamental to them and the same over the many situations that they pass through that's seen as primarily responsible for whatever happened.
Personality is how people usually explain things. 
And for a long time, it was how many psychologists explained things too. 
And then came a man named Walter Mischel, who helped transform the way that psychology thinks about what makes us us.
You see, in 1968, Walter Mischel, the man that you just heard, wrote a book that challenged some of the most basic ideas that we have about the role that personality plays in our lives. 
You probably don't know the book. It has the extremely unsplashy title "Personality And Assessment." 
But you probably do know something about Walter Mischel because he is the man behind one of America's favorite experiments.
This is a re-enactment we found on YouTube of Mischel's famous marshmallow test. You sit a kid in a room in front of a delicious marshmallow.
Tell them that you're going to leave the room. And if they can delay their gratification and not eat the marshmallow until you come back, they'll get two marshmallows instead of one.
A small test seen as having huge implications.
This is from a CBS report.
Basically, over the last two decades, the marshmallow test has become a kind of poster child for the idea that there are specific personality traits that we all have inside of us that are stable and consistent and will determine our lives far into the future.
There is only one tiny problem with this interpretation, as Walter Mischel himself will tell you.
So I promise that later, I will explain exactly what is wrong with how the marshmallow test is usually portrayed.
But to get the full force of how ironic it is that Mischel's marshmallow test has taken on the cultural meaning that it has, you really have to go back to 1961, when Mischel was a professor at Harvard University and got assigned to teach a course on personality.
See, Mischel, like pretty much every psychologist at the time, had a bunch of basic assumptions about personality.
The first was that people did have different personalities and that those different personalities could be defined by looking at their traits - traits like you heard at the beginning of the show.
There are all kinds of traits.
And at the time, personality researchers liked to argue over which were most important. 
But the thing they almost never argued about was the other major assumption of the field of the time, which is that whatever traits you had were stable over time and consistent across different situations.
So an honest person is an honest person and a dishonest person is a dishonest person?
